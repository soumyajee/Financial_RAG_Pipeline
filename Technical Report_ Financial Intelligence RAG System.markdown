- **Rationale**:
  - **Asynchronous Processing**: Supports concurrent handling of market data requests and document uploads, critical for real-time performance.
  - **API Documentation**: Automatically generates clear endpoint specifications (as seen in `api.markdown`), reducing documentation overhead.
  - **Scalability**: Efficiently handles multiple requests with low latency, as evidenced by the 0.02–0.45-second response times in the API documentation.
- **Implementation**: The API includes endpoints for health checks (`/health`), market data retrieval (`/market-data/{symbol}`), document uploads (`/upload-document`), and intelligent queries (`/query`), as detailed in `api.markdown`.

### 2. Data Processing: Yahoo Finance and SQLite
- **Decision**: Yahoo Finance was selected as the primary data source for real-time market data, with SQLite as the local database for persistence.
- **Rationale**:
  - **Yahoo Finance**: A free, reliable source for stock and crypto data (e.g., AAPL, BTC-USD), meeting the task’s requirement to avoid paid APIs.
  - **SQLite**: Lightweight, serverless, and sufficient for local storage of market data and metadata, ensuring easy deployment without external dependencies.
  - **Data Validation**: Incoming data is validated for completeness (e.g., checking for missing prices) and stored with timestamps for efficient querying.
- **Implementation**: Market data is fetched periodically, processed to calculate technical indicators (e.g., SMA, EMA, RSI, volatility), and stored in `market_data.db`, as referenced in `demo.markdown`.

### 3. RAG Implementation: FAISS and Hugging Face Transformers
- **Decision**: FAISS was chosen for vector storage, and a Hugging Face transformer model (e.g., BERT-based) was used for embeddings and LLM integration.
- **Rationale**:
  - **FAISS**: A free, efficient vector database for semantic search, enabling fast similarity-based retrieval of document chunks.
  - **Hugging Face**: Provides access to free, pre-trained models for text embedding and response generation, avoiding paid API dependencies.
  - **RAG Pipeline**: Documents are chunked, embedded, and indexed in FAISS, with the LLM generating contextual responses based on retrieved content and market data.
- **Implementation**: The `/query` endpoint integrates real-time data and document insights, providing source attribution (e.g., `earnings.pdf`, `market_data.db`) as shown in `api.markdown`.

### 4. Web Interface: Streamlit
- **Decision**: Streamlit was selected for the optional web interface due to its simplicity and built-in support for data visualization.
- **Rationale**:
  - **Rapid Development**: Enables quick creation of a responsive, interactive UI for document uploads, data visualization, and query submission.
  - **Visualization**: Integrates seamlessly with Plotly for charts (e.g., price trends, technical indicators), as described in `demo.markdown`.
  - **Ease of Use**: Requires minimal frontend expertise, aligning with the task’s focus on Python-centric development.
- **Implementation**: The interface supports document uploads, market data dashboards, query interfaces, and system status monitoring, accessible at `http://localhost:8501` (`demo.markdown`).

### 5. System Monitoring: Custom Logging and Health Checks
- **Decision**: Custom logging and a dedicated `/health` endpoint were implemented for system monitoring.
- **Rationale**:
  - **Logging**: Tracks API requests, errors, and performance metrics (e.g., response time, memory usage) in `api_log.txt`, ensuring transparency.
  - **Health Checks**: The `/health` endpoint provides real-time system status (e.g., uptime, documents processed), as shown in `api.markdown`.
  - **Resilience**: Graceful degradation is achieved by caching market data locally when external APIs are unavailable.
- **Implementation**: Metrics like processing rate (10.5 documents/second) and response time (0.02–1.25 seconds) are exposed via the API and web interface.

### 6. Deployment: Local Execution with Docker (Optional)
- **Decision**: The system is designed to run locally, with an optional Docker configuration for consistent deployment.
- **Rationale**:
  - **Local Execution**: Meets the task’s requirement for no paid cloud services, using free tools like SQLite and FAISS.
  - **Docker**: Simplifies environment setup by packaging dependencies, ensuring reproducibility across systems.
- **Implementation**: A `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` are included for optional containerized deployment, as suggested in the task guidelines.

## Implementation Challenges
Developing the system presented several challenges, which were addressed through careful design and iterative refinement:

### 1. Real-Time Data Processing
- **Challenge**: Ensuring low-latency processing of continuous market data updates without performance degradation.
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented asynchronous data fetching using `aiohttp` to handle Yahoo Finance API calls concurrently.
  - Used a sliding window for technical indicator calculations to minimize computational overhead.
  - Stored data in SQLite with indexed timestamps for efficient querying, achieving response times of ~0.03 seconds for `/market-data` requests (`api.markdown`).
- **Impact**: The system handles updates for five symbols (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, TSLA, BTC-USD) with minimal latency, as demonstrated in `demo.markdown`.

### 2. RAG System Integration
- **Challenge**: Combining real-time market data with document-based insights for complex queries.
- **Solution**:
  - Developed a hybrid query pipeline that retrieves relevant document chunks from FAISS and integrates them with market data via the LLM.
  - Used prompt engineering to ensure the LLM synthesizes both data sources coherently, as seen in the `/query` endpoint response structure (`api.markdown`).
  - Implemented source attribution to maintain transparency, addressing the task’s requirement for traceability.
- **Impact**: The system accurately responds to queries like “What is Apple’s stock performance compared to their latest earnings guidance?” with clear source references.

### 3. Document Processing
- **Challenge**: Efficiently processing large PDF documents (e.g., SEC filings) while maintaining semantic accuracy.
- **Solution**:
  - Used `PyPDF2` for text extraction and chunking, with preprocessing to remove noise (e.g., headers, footers).
  - Optimized FAISS indexing by balancing chunk size (500 tokens) and embedding batch processing to reduce memory usage.
  - Handled edge cases like malformed PDFs with robust error handling, returning descriptive error messages in the `/upload-document` response.
- **Impact**: Achieved a processing rate of ~10 pages/second, as noted in the `/upload-document` response (`api.markdown`).

### 4. API Scalability and Rate Limiting
- **Challenge**: Preventing API overload while maintaining accessibility.
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented rate limiting (e.g., 20 requests/min for `/health`, 10 for `/query`) using FastAPI middleware.
  - Added input validation to reject invalid symbols or malformed queries, returning appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400, 429).
  - Optimized database queries to reduce latency, ensuring `/market-data` responses remain under 0.03 seconds.
- **Impact**: The API maintains stability under load, as evidenced by the performance metrics in `api.markdown`.

### 5. Web Interface Usability
- **Challenge**: Creating a responsive, intuitive interface with minimal frontend expertise.
- **Solution**:
  - Leveraged Streamlit’s built-in components for document uploads, dropdowns, and Plotly charts, reducing development time.
  - Customized layouts with Streamlit’s `st.columns` and `st.sidebar` for responsiveness across devices (`demo.markdown`).
  - Added system status indicators using API calls to `/health`, providing real-time feedback to users.
- **Impact**: The interface is user-friendly and supports all required functionalities, as demonstrated in the demo steps (`demo.markdown`).
